# Luca Gouvea Ebury Test

welcome, feel free to test my application!

Use the create_scratch_org.sh script to deploy the project.

Please use the "Ebury" lightning app - there you can find the components to create new Trades.

The table presented has as default 10 rows per pagination. That number can be easily changed in the component's Design Attributes.

If you want to run tests with a different user (not admin) - please use the Ebury_App permissionSet.
